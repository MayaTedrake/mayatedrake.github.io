                I volunteer at Grammy Rose Dog Rescue, a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing and rehoming dogs in need. Grammy Rose is a no-kill shelter that takes in dogs from anywhere that they can. I have been volunteering there since 2022.

            When I went on the "Project Costa Rica 20 Day" trip with Rein Teen Tours, I volunteered at a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sU9kxBMpwQKVyXYx6" style="color: #00008B; text-decoration: none;">dog shelter</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uyuS4Yk14a5kqz77A" style="color: #00008B; text-decoration: none;">private rainforest reserve</a>, and a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vD2WtNB3uStPm8DU7" style="color: #00008B; text-decoration: none;">wildlife refuge</a>. At the dog shelter, we would spend time with the dogs, washing them, playing with them, and taking them on walks. Our job there was to make sure the dogs felt loved, were happy, and were healthy. The dog shelter would also have us clean and paint the facility. At the rainforest reserve, we would help keep the trails clear by shoveling so that there are places to put railings and then finally painting the rails finally green. At the wildlife refuge, we would clean the beach by picking up trash and moving dead sticks so that the turtles and other wildlife can lay their eggs and thrive in the wild.

                I volunteered at the Needham Public Library, helping to organize and maintain the library's children's collection, organize and supervise the children's 5+ lego room. I would go to the library and be incharge of the lego room every thursday. I would spent time with the kids, entertain them, make sure they get along, and I would end up supervising them while their parents were else where.            </p>
