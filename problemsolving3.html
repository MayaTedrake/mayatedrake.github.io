            The Great Cover is a design project that I created with other classmates. The assignment was to create something that has not already been made, and to create something specific to the needs of someone in our community. Our problem was from Ms. Stublarec, she wanted a way to still use her sink but to stop from getting unwanted things inside the sink. Our solution to this problem was to create a cover for the sink with small hokes so it can fit liquids but nothing else. The grade also has an addition to it that allows it hook to the underside of the inside of the sink, so it can be removed if necesarry. Ms. Stublarec was extremely happy with the product, and wanted more for her other sinks.
