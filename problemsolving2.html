            The Any Wear is a design project that I created with other classmates. The assignment was to create something that has not already been made, and to create something specific to the needs of someone in our team. Our problem was the effect of hair ties on your wrist, so our solution to this problem was to create an addition to the magnetic phone case with a slot in the middle and a loop to hold the hair ties. An addition to the pony tail holder was a way to open and close the clasp to create a phone stand as well, this is also detachable from the case. The end product was very efficient and I personally would use the product myself.
